If I wasn't so lazy I'd configure this pixel art shader as a custom postprocessing effect for
@react-three/postprocessing 😮‍💨

Instead I settled for updating Kody's implementation for R3F - also added some leva controls

Going to be using this for my fitswitch project so that my app can have a retro video game feel!
